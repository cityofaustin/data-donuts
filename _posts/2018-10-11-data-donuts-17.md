Scoot Scoot! The scooter wars are hot. Join us this month to learn how the development of a humble data standard is transforming the ability of cities to regulate new micro-mobility companies. The developers and maintainers of the Mobility Data Specification (MDS) work for the City of Los Angeles and the City of Santa Monica by day. They'll share what it's like to see [their work in wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/cities-scooter-data-remix-uber-lyft/) to their hope and dreams for playing with new streams of mobility data.
