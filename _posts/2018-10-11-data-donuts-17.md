Scoot Scoot! The scooter wars are hot. Join us this month to learn how the development of a humble data standard is transforming the ability of cities to regulate new micro-mobility companies. The developers and maintainers of the [Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification) work for the City of Los Angeles and the City of Santa Monica by day. They'll share what it's like to see [their work in wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/cities-scooter-data-remix-uber-lyft/) to their hope and dreams for playing with new streams of mobility data.
