# Speaker
__Voting Systems Assessment Project Team__<br>
_Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk_

The Voting Systems Assessment Project is Los Angeles Countyâ€™s effort to design, develop and implement a modernized voting experience. This innovative project will produce a certified voting system that is publicly owned. The project has taken a data-driven approach and utilized human centered design principles to ensure that the unique needs of our voters are met. During this presentation we will provide an update on the progress of the project as well as a discussion of how data and human centered design principles work together.

_*** Due to a last minute emergency, a member of the Voting Systems Assessment Project will speak in place of Wendy Harn. ***_
